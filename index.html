			On Sunday, <strong>President Donald Trump</strong> stated that the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>North Korea</strong> will resume delayed nuclear talks, a historic step onto North Korean land. North Korean leader <strong>Kim Jong Un</strong> made the declaration during a special last-minute gathering.

			Trump made history when he became the first sitting US president to cross the 1953 armistice line between North and South Korea, standing side by side with Kim in the heavily fortified demilitarized zone before sitting down with him for a 50-minute conversation.

			It was their third meeting since Trump took office, but none of them has resulted in a nuclear agreement.

			The summit was hailed as a success by Trump, who stated that nuclear talks would begin "within weeks" and that the two countries would choose teams of officials to lead them.
